In theory, you've installed Git+R. If it is not the case, you have a great tutorial [here](https://www.geo.uzh.ch/microsite/reproducible_research/post/rr-rstudio-git/) to install it in your machine.

From now on, you will never ever open a single R script and lose it due to your disorganized workplace.\
‚úÖ In the upper side of your window, go to File > New Project > Version Control.\

Here you will get two options:
- Either you want to look at a script from an amazing paper you've seen.
- You want to start a new project from your own (It requires a Github account! ‚ö†Ô∏è)

In the former, you will copy paste the URL of the repository (e.g., in our case, you want to get this repository on your laptop because you've spotted a mistake and you want to correct it. How good you are! üòá)\
The URL will be: ``https://github.com/JayCrlt/GitHub_Tutorial``
